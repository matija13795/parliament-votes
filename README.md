# European Parliament Voting Analysis

## Overview
This project visualizes the voting patterns of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) by Political Group over the entire history of the European Parliament, from its first parliamentary term until 2024. Our goal is to help European citizens understand how their representatives have voted on issues, and whether their political groups align with their own beliefs.

This tool is particularly useful for citizens who want to make informed decisions in future elections by seeing how well their MEPs represent their interests.

## Purpose
Imagine you are a German citizen. You might want to know if your MEPs have been voting in alignment with your values and preferences. With this project, you can:
- See the voting trends of your countryâ€™s MEPs over time.
- Compare the voting records of different Political Groups to understand their alignment with key issues.
- Identify representatives or political groups that may not align with your beliefs, helping you make an informed decision for the next election.
